📧 SMS Spam Detection using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes
This is my first Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, where I built a Spam vs. Ham (SMS classification) model using:

TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn

Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

✅ The dataset was manually created inside the Jupyter notebook as Python lists (no external CSV file).

🛠️Technologies Used
sklearn (TF-IDF, train_test_split, MultinomialNB, accuracy_score)
